I am arguing in favor of changing the Electoral College to the election of by popular vote. The process of the votes going through the various different places until it finally gets counted and determined who wins the state is unneccesary. The system is not even fair, for example in the year 2000 Al Gore had one the popular vote by 60%. Unfortunatley he lost the presidency because he did not win the the votes of the Electoral College. For a counry that is ran by the people, a vote of over 50% should always win. When you take into consideration how big the United States are, then cut that into half it is still a remarkable amount. Now picture a little over half the people in the United States voting for the same thing.

A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
And even the like precurse of fierce events,
As harbingers preceding still the fates
And prologue to the omen coming on,
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
Unto our climatures and countrymen.—
But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
Re-enter Ghost
I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
Speak to me:
If there be any good thing to be done,
That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
Speak to me:
Cock crows
If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.

Dear mister Plump. I am writing to you on behalf of all students, claiming our old seminar practice back. I know, it is now considered outdated but we all agree that it is much better than the new one, don't we? Hope this email finds you well

Once upon a time, in a world not too different from ours, there existed a magical forest known as Whisperwood. This enchanted forest was shrouded in mystery and was home to various creatures, each with unique abilities and stories. The forest was a place of tranquility, where the leaves whispered secrets to the wind, and the trees held ancient wisdom.
The forest was guarded by a wise old owl named Sage, who kept watch over the creatures and ensured harmony within Whisperwood. Among these creatures were Luna, a unicorn with the power to heal, Breeze, a mischievous sprite who could control the wind, and Shadow, a nocturnal panther with the ability to blend into the darkness.
One day, a mysterious stranger appeared in Whisperwood. He was tall and had an air of mystery about him. He claimed to be a seeker of knowledge and asked Sage about the creatures of the forest. Intrigued, Sage decided to share their stories, but warned the stranger about the dangers that lurked in the forest.
The stranger, however, was undeterred. He embarked on a journey through Whisperwood, meeting each creature and learning about their abilities. He was amazed by Luna's healing powers, captivated by Breeze's playful antics, and intrigued by Shadow's elusive nature.
Meanwhile, the creatures of Whisperwood faced a threat. A dark force was spreading its influence, corrupting the trees and turning the leaves black. The creatures knew they had to act, but they were divided on how to confront this new danger.
The stranger, having learned about the creatures' abilities, decided to help. He suggested they combine their powers to face the dark force. At first, the creatures were skeptical, but the stranger's words of wisdom and his own bravery inspired them.
Together, they faced the dark force, using Luna's healing powers to mend the corrupted trees, Breeze's wind control to disperse the darkness, and Shadow's camouflage to strike unexpectedly. With their combined efforts, they were able to defeat the dark force and restore the peace of Whisperwood.
